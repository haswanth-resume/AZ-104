1. You have Azure subscription that includes virtual network with following subnets: 
• Subnet1, which has connected virtual machine 
• Subnet2, which has connected web app 
• Subnet3, which has connected container instance 
You plan to deploy container instance named container1.
To which subnets can you connect container1?
Select only one answer. 

Subnet3 only 
Subnet1 and Subnet3 only 
Subnet2 and Subnet3 only
Subnet1, Subnet2 and Subnet3 

Ans: Subnet 3 only
Explaination: 
To deploy a new container instance named container1, you need to ensure that the subnet you choose is properly configured for Azure Container Instances. 
Specifically, the subnet must be dedicated to container instances and cannot contain other resource types.

2. You have an Azure Storage account named storage1 that contains a file share named share1. 
You also have an on-premises Active Directory domain that contains a user named User1. 
You need to ensure that User1 can access share1 by using the SMB protocol.
What should you do? Select only one answer. 

•  Provide User1 with the shared access signature (SAS) for storage1.
•  Configure the Access control (IAM) settings of storage1. 
•  Configure the Firewalls and virtual networks settings of storage1. 
•  Provide User1 with the access key for storage1. 

Ans:  Configure the Access control (IAM) settings of storage1.
Explaination: 
To ensure that User1 can access the Azure file share named share1 using the SMB protocol, you need to integrate your Azure Storage account with your on-premises Active Directory (AD). 
This involves registering your storage account with your on-premises AD and setting the required domain properties on the storage account1.
This will allow you to assign the necessary permissions to User1, enabling access via SMB with their AD credentials.

3. You have an Azure storage account named storage1. Three users use the following methods to access the data in storage1:
• User1 uses the Azure portal 
• User2 uses the Azure Storage Explorer 
• User3 uses File Explorer in Windows 11 
You generate a storage access signature named SAS1 for storage1. 
Which user or users can access storage1 by using SAS1?
Select only one answer. 

• User1 only 
• User2 only 
• User1 and User2 only 
• User2 and User3 only 
• User1, User2 and User3

Answer: • User1, User2 and User3

4. Your Azure AD contains three users named User1, User2, and User3.
You have an Azure storage account named storage1 that has the following access: 
• User1 is assigned the Storage Account Contributor role on storage1 
• User2 has a access key for storage1 
• User3 has a shared access signature for storage1 
You rotate the keys for storage1. Which user or users can access storage1? 
Select only one answer. 

• User1 only 
• User1 and User2 only 
• User2 and User3 only 
• User1, User2 and User3 

Ans: User1 only 
Explaination: 
When you rotate the keys for an Azure storage account, any existing access keys and shared access signatures (SAS) generated with the old keys will no longer be valid. 
This means:
User1, who is assigned the Storage Account Contributor role, will still have access because their access is based on role-based access control (RBAC) and not dependent on the storage account keys.
User2, who has an access key, will lose access because the key they have will be invalid after rotation.
User3, who has a SAS, will also lose access because the SAS token will be invalid after the key rotation.

5. You have an Azure Storage account named storage1. You need to provide time-limited access to storage1. 
What should you use? 
Select only one answer. 

• an access key 
• a role assignment 
• an access policy 
• a shared access signature (SAS) 

Answer:  a shared access signature (SAS) 
Explaination:
To provide time-limited access to your Azure Storage account named storage1, you should use a shared access signature (SAS). 
A SAS token allows you to grant limited access to your storage resources without sharing your account key, and you can specify the start and expiry time for the access.

You purchase a DNS domain named contoso.com. 
You create an Azure public DNS zone named contoso.com that contains a host record for Server1.
You need to ensure that internet users can resolve the name server1.contoso.com. 
Which type of DNS record should you add to the domain registrar? Select only one answer. 
• A 
• NS 
• SOA 
• TXT

Answer:  NS 
Explaination: 
To ensure that internet users can resolve the name server1.contoso.com, you should add an NS (Name Server) record to the domain registrar.
This record will point to the Azure DNS name servers that are authoritative for the contoso.com zone.

You have an Azure private DNS zone named contoso.com that contains the following records: 
• @ of type SOA, which is NOT auto-registered 
• @ of type A, which is NOT auto-registered 
• Server1 of type A, which is auto-registered 
• Server2 of type TXT, which is NOT auto-registered 
Which three records can be deleted from contoso.com? 
Select all answers that apply. 
@ of type SOA 
@ of type A 
Server1 of type A 
Server2 of type TXT

Answer:   
@ of type SOA 
@ of type A 
Server2 of type TXT 

Explaination: 
In your Azure private DNS zone named contoso.com, you can delete the following three records:
@ of type SOA (which is NOT auto-registered)
@ of type A (which is NOT auto-registered)
Server2 of type TXT (which is NOT auto-registered)
The Server1 of type A record should not be deleted as it is auto-registered and likely in use.

A company named Contoso, Ltd. has an Azure subscription that is linked to an Azure AD tenant named contoso.com. 
The Azure subscription contains the following virtual networks: 
• VNET1- deployed in the East US location 
• VNET2- deployed in the East US location 
• VNET3- deployed in the West US location 
Contoso purchases a company named A. Datum Corporation. 
A. Datum has an Azure subscription that contains an Azure AD tenant named adatum.com. Adatum.com contains the following virtual networks:
• VNETA- deployed in the East US location 
• VNETB- deployed in the West US location 
Which virtual networks can you peer to VNET1?

• VNET2 only 
• VNET2 and VNET3 only 
• VNET2 and VNETA only 
• VNET2, VNET3, and VNETA only 
• VNET2, VNET3, VNETA, and VNETB 

Answer: • VNET2 and VNETA only
Explaination: 
These virtual networks are in the same region (East US) as VNET1, making them eligible for peering. 
VNET3 and VNETB, being in the West US location, cannot be peered with VNET1 due to the regional difference.


You have an Azure virtual network named VNET1 that has an IP address space of 192.168.0.0/16 and the following subnets: 
• Subnet1- has an IP address range of 192.168.1.0/24 and is connected to 15 VMs 
• Subnet2- has an IP address range of 192.168.2.0/24 and does NOT have any VMs connected
You need to ensure that you can deploy Azure Firewall to VNET1. What should you do?
Select only one answer.

• Add a new subnet to VNET1.
• Add a service endpoint to Subnet2.
• Modify the subnet mask of Subnet2. 
• Modify the IP address space of VNET1.

Answer: Add a new subnet to VNET1.
Explaination: 
To deploy Azure Firewall to VNET1, you need to add a new subnet to VNET1. 
This subnet must be named AzureFirewallSubnet and should have a minimum subnet size of /26.

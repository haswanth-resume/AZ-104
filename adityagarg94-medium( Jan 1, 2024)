Answer-100

Explanation-
Priority:
-A number between 100 and 4096.
-Rules are processed in priority order, with lower numbers processed before higher numbers, because lower numbers have higher priority.
-Once traffic matches a rule, processing stops.
-As a result, any rules that exist with lower priorities (higher numbers) that have the same attributes as rules with higher priorities arenâ€™t processed.
Azure default security rules are given the highest number with the lowest priority to ensure that custom rules are always processed first.

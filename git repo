# Renewal for Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate
## AZ-104 RENEWAL ASSESSMENT 38 QUESTIONS

#### Question 1 of 26
You plan to deploy the following Azure web apps:
- WebApp1, that uses the .NET 6 runtime stack
- WebApp2, that uses the ASP.NET V4.8 runtime stack
- WebApp3, that uses the Java 17 runtime stack
- WebApp4, that uses the PHP 8.0 runtime stack
You need to create the app service plans for the web apps.
What is the minimum number of app service plans that should be created?
Select only one answer.

1. 1
2. 2 
3. 3
4. 4 

Ans: 4
Explaination:
Each of these web apps uses a different runtime stack.
Therefore, you will need to create a separate app service plan for each runtime stack.
So, the minimum number of app service plans that should be created is four.

#### Question 2 of 26
You plan to deploy an Azure web app that will have the following settings:
- Name: WebApp1
- Publish: Docker Container
- Operating system: Windows
- Region: West US
- Windows Plan (West US): ASP-RG1-8bcf
You need to ensure that WebApp1 uses the ASP.NET V4.8 runtime stack.
Which setting should you modify?

Select only one answer.
1. Operating system
2. Publish
3. Region
4. Windows Plan

Ans: Publish 
Explaination:
To ensure that WebApp1 uses the ASP.NET V4.8 runtime stack, you should modify the Publish setting.
Since ASP.NET V4.8 is a framework that runs on Windows, you need to publish the app as a Code rather than a Docker Container. Docker containers are typically used for Linux-based deployments or custom environments, whereas ASP.NET V4.8 is best supported directly on Windows without containerization.

#### Question 3 of 26
You plan to deploy an Azure web app that will have the following settings:
- Name: WebApp1
- Publish: Code
- Runtime stack: Java 11
- Operating system: Linux

Which setting should you modify?

Select only one answer.
1. Continuous deployment  
2. Operating system
3. Publish
4. Runtime stack

2. blob, file, table, and queue
3. blob only
4. file only
5. table and queue only

Ans: blob and file only
Explaination: Customer-managed keys (Scope2) are indeed used for scenarios where you want more control over the encryption keys. 
Azure Blob Storage and Azure File Storage support customer-managed keys, allowing you to manage and rotate your own keys.

#### Question 9 of 26
You have an Azure Storage account named storage1 that is configured to use the Hot access tier.
Storage1 has a container named container1 and the lifecycle management rule with following settings:
- Move blob to cool storage: Selected
- Days after last modification: 3

2. storage1 and storage3 only
3. storage1 only
4. Storage1, storage2 and storage3

Therefore, you can use lifecycle management with:
storage1 (configured as StorageV2 kind)
storage2 (configured as BlobStorage kind)
storage3 (configured as FileStorage kind) does not support lifecycle management policies.

Ans:  Microsoft Entra ID, storage key, shared access signature or certificate 

#### Question 12 of 26
You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account named storage1 and the following virtual machines:
- VM1 has a public IP address of 13.68.158.24 and is connected to VNET1/Subnet1
- VM2 has a public IP address of 52.255.145.76 and is connected to VNET1/Subnet1
- VM3 has a public IP address of 13.68.158.50 and is connected to VNET1/Subnet2

The subnets have the following service endpoints:
- Subnet1 has a Microsoft.Storage service endpoint
- Subnet2 does NOT have any service endpoint
- Storage1 has a firewall configured to allow access from the 13.68.158.0/24 IP address range only.

Which virtual machines can access storage1.

Select only one answer.
1. VM1 and VM2 only 
2. VM1 and VM3 only
3. VM1 only 
4. VM1, VM2, and VM3
5. VM3 only

Ans: VM1 and VM3 only 
Explaination: 
VM1 and VM3 have IP addresses within the allowed range (13.68.158.0/24).
VM2 has an IP address outside the allowed range (52.255.145.76).
Subnet1 has a Microsoft.Storage service endpoint, but Subnet2 does not.
Since the firewall allows access only from the 13.68.158.0/24 IP address range and VM1 and VM3 fall within this range, they can access storage1. 
VM2 cannot access storage1 because its IP address is outside the allowed range.

- 10.10.2.0/28

VNET1 contains the following subnets:
- Subnet1- has an address space of 10.10.1.0/24
- Subnet2- has an address space of 10.10.2.0/28
To Subnet1, you deploy a virtual machine named VM1 that runs Windows Server 2022. VM1 has Remote Desktop enabled.
VM1 does NOT have a public IP address.
You need to be able to deploy Azure Bastion to protect VM1.
What should you do first?

Select only one answer.
1. Add a new subnet to VNET1.
2. Add a public IP address to VM1.
3. Add an extension to VM1.

Ans: Modify the address space of VNET1.
Explaination:
To deploy Azure Bastion, you need to create a dedicated subnet named AzureBastionSubnet within your virtual network. This subnet must have a prefix of at least /27.
Given your current address spaces, you don’t have enough available address space to create this subnet. Therefore, the first step is to modify the address space of VNET1 to ensure you have enough space to add the required subnet.

You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1 that connects to a virtual network named VNET1 .
You create a private DNS zone named contoso.com and add an A record named host1 to the zone.

What should you do?

Modify the Access control (IAM) settings of the zone.
From the zone, add a virtual network link. 
From the properties of the network interface, modify the options of the DNS servers.
From the properties Of VNETI, modify the options Of the DNS servers.

Ans: From the zone, add a virtual network link. 

You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1 that automatically registers in an Azure private DNS zone named contoso.com.
VM1 hosts a website named Site1.
You need to ensure that Site1 can be resolved by using a URL of http://www.contoso.com. The solution must ensure that if the IP
address of VM1 changes, www.contoso.com will resolve to the changed IP address.
Which DNS record type should you add to contoso.com?
A
SVR
TXT 
CNAME

Ans: CNAME
Explaination:
To ensure that www.contoso.com resolves to the IP address of VM1 and automatically updates if the IP address changes, 
you should use a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. A CNAME record maps an alias name (like www.contoso.com) to another domain name (like host1.contoso.com), 
which in turn resolves to the IP address of VM1. 
This way, if the IP address of VM1 changes, 
the CNAME record will still point to the correct address through the alias.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual network named VNet1, a private DNS zone named contoso.com and the
following resources that are connected to VNet1:

• Container1, a container instance
• LB1, a load balancer
Contoso.com is linked to VNet1. Auto registration is enabled.
Which resource or resources are registered in contoso.com?

VM1 only
VM1 and VM2 only
VM1, VM2 and Container1 only
VM1, VM2 and LB1 only
VM1, VM2, Container1 and LB1

Ans: VM1 and VM2 only 
Explaination:
With auto registration enabled in an Azure private DNS zone, 
only virtual machines are automatically registered. 
This means that DNS records are created for virtual machines, 
but not for other resources like container instances or load balancers.

With auto-registration enabled for the private DNS zone contoso.com and VNet1, VM1 and VM2 will be automatically registered. 
Container instances and load balancers do not support auto-registration in private DNS zones.

Question 12 of 28
You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1 that automatically registers in an Azure private DNS zone named contoso.com.
VMI hosts a website named Sitel.
You need to ensure that Sitel can be resolved by using a URL of http:t/www.contoso.com. The solution must ensure that if the IP
address of VM1 changes, mvw.contoso.com will resolve to the changed IP address.
Which DNS record type should you add to contoso.com?

SVR
TXT
AAAA
CNAME

Ans: CNAME
Explaination: 
To ensure that the website Sitel hosted on VM1 can be resolved using the URL http://www.contoso.com and that it automatically updates if the IP address of VM1 changes, 
you should add a CNAME (Canonical Name) record to the contoso.com DNS zone.
A CNAME record maps an alias name (like www.contoso.com) to a true or canonical domain name (such as the DNS name of VM1). 
This way, if the IP address of VM1 changes, the alias will still resolve correctly to the updated IP address.

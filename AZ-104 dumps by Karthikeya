You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1 that connects to a virtual network named VNET1 .
You create a private DNS zone named contoso.com and add an A record named host1 to the zone.

What should you do?

Modify the Access control (IAM) settings of the zone.
From the zone, add a virtual network link. 
From the properties of the network interface, modify the options of the DNS servers.
From the properties Of VNETI, modify the options Of the DNS servers.

Ans: From the zone, add a virtual network link. 

You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1 that automatically registers in an Azure private DNS zone named contoso.com.
VM1 hosts a website named Site1.
You need to ensure that Site1 can be resolved by using a URL of http://www.contoso.com. 
The solution must ensure that if the IP
address of VM1 changes, www.contoso.com will resolve to the changed IP address.
Which DNS record type should you add to contoso.com?
A
SVR
TXT 
CNAME

Ans: CNAME
Explaination:
To ensure that www.contoso.com resolves to the IP address of VM1 and automatically updates if the IP address changes, 
you should use a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. A CNAME record maps an alias name (like www.contoso.com) to another domain name (like host1.contoso.com), 
which in turn resolves to the IP address of VM1. 
This way, if the IP address of VM1 changes, 
the CNAME record will still point to the correct address through the alias.

• Container1, a container instance
• LB1, a load balancer
Contoso.com is linked to VNet1. Auto registration is enabled.
Which resource or resources are registered in contoso.com?

VM1 only
VM1 and VM2 only
VM1, VM2 and Container1 only
VM1, VM2 and LB1 only
VM1, VM2, Container1 and LB1

Ans: VM1 and VM2 only 
Explaination:
With auto registration enabled in an Azure private DNS zone, 
only virtual machines are automatically registered. 
This means that DNS records are created for virtual machines, 
but not for other resources like container instances or load balancers.

With auto-registration enabled for the private DNS zone contoso.com and VNet1, VM1 and VM2 will be automatically registered. 
Container instances and load balancers do not support auto-registration in private DNS zones.

Question 12 of 28
You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1 that automatically registers in an Azure private DNS zone named contoso.com.
VMI hosts a website named Sitel.
You need to ensure that Sitel can be resolved by using a URL of http:t/www.contoso.com. The solution must ensure that if the IP
address of VM1 changes, mvw.contoso.com will resolve to the changed IP address.
Which DNS record type should you add to contoso.com?

SVR
TXT
AAAA
CNAME

Ans: CNAME
Explaination: 
To ensure that the website Sitel hosted on VM1 can be resolved using the URL http://www.contoso.com and that it automatically updates if the IP address of VM1 changes, 
you should add a CNAME (Canonical Name) record to the contoso.com DNS zone.
A CNAME record maps an alias name (like www.contoso.com) to a true or canonical domain name (such as the DNS name of VM1). 
This way, if the IP address of VM1 changes, the alias will still resolve correctly to the updated IP address.

Question 13 ot 28
You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual network named VNet1, a private DNS zone named contoso.com and the
following resources that are connected to VNet1:
• VM1, a virtual machine that is running Windows Server 2022
• VM2, a virtual machine that is running Linux
• Container1, a container instance
• LB1, a load balancer
Contoso.com is linked to VNet1. Auto registration is enabled.
Which resource or resources are registered in contoso.com?

VM1 only
VM1 and VM2 only
VM1, VM2 and Container1 only
VM1, VM2 and LB1 only
VM1, VM2, Container1 and LB1

Ans: VM1 and VM2 only 
Explaination:
With auto registration enabled in an Azure private DNS zone, 
only virtual machines are automatically registered. 
This means that DNS records are created for virtual machines, 
but not for other resources like container instances or load balancers.


Question 14 of 28
You purchase a DNS domain named contoso.com. 
You create an Azure public DNS zone named contoso.com that contains a host record for Server1.
You need to ensure that internet users can resolve the name server1.contoso.com. 
Which type of DNS record should you add to the domain registrar? Select only one answer. 
• A 
• NS 
• SOA 
• TXT

Answer:  NS 
Explaination: 
To ensure that internet users can resolve the name server1.contoso.com, you should add an NS (Name Server) record to the domain registrar.
This record will point to the Azure DNS name servers that are authoritative for the contoso.com zone.


Question 15 of 28
You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual network named VNET1. VNET1 uses the following address spaces:
- 10.10.1.0/24
- 10.10.2.0/28

VNET1 contains the following subnets:
- Subnet1- has an address space of 10.10.1.0/24
- Subnet2- has an address space of 10.10.2.0/28
To Subnet1, you deploy a virtual machine named VM1 that runs Windows Server 2022. VM1 has Remote Desktop enabled.
VM1 does NOT have a public IP address.
You need to be able to deploy Azure Bastion to protect VM1.
What should you do first?

Select only one answer.
1. Add a new subnet to VNET1.
2. Add a public IP address to VM1.
3. Add an extension to VM1.
4. Modify the address space of VNET1.

Ans: Add a new subnet to VNET1.
Explaination:
To deploy Azure Bastion, you need to create a dedicated subnet named AzureBastionSubnet within your virtual network. This subnet must have a prefix of at least /27.
Given your current address spaces, you don’t have enough available address space to create this subnet. Therefore, the first step is to modify the address space of VNET1 to ensure you have enough space to add the required subnet.
